o	Through the utilization of leading Machine Learning techniques, developed an ensemble model that adeptly identifies thyroid concerns in patients.
o	The model's goal is to determine whether a patient is Normal or suffering from Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism using the input data provided by the patient.
o	The workflow is to import essential packages and dataset that contain 21 attributes and splitting 70% of the dataset into training and 30% into testing, then selecting and ensembling the algorithms based on the majority upvoting and selecting the best-ensembled model based on the accuracy achieved.
